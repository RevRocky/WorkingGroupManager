<p>Hello New Rebels,<br /><br />Per your interest at the orientation, we've added you to the mailing lists of the different subgroups that you have expressed interest in. One of the benefits of subgroups is that they allow for all different levels of involvement. For your benefit, descriptions of each subgroup have been included below so you can better find out how you can contribute to the rebellion! If you have any questions or wish to be connected with the coordinators of this working group to learn more and take a more active involvement do not hesitate to reach out to the sub-group shepherd {SHEPHERD_NAME} who will be happy to help.<br /><br /></p>
<p>{SUB_GROUP_DESCRIPTIONS}<br /><br />Love and Rage,<br />{MASTER_GROUP}</p>
