    Hello {NAME},
    <br />
    <br />
    I am writing to let you know that you have been added to the mailing list for the {WORKING_GROUP} group of {MASTER_GROUP} and to put you in touch with the co-leads of this group in case you have any questions about meeting times or the workings of the group!
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of co-leads, the co-leads of the {WORKING_GROUP} group are {CO_LEADS}. I've taken the liberty of cc'ing them in this email so that they can make a more, ahem, organic introduction!
    <br />
    <br />Love, Rage &amp; Robots,
    <br />Robot
    <br />
    <em>
        On behalf of {MASTER_GROUP}
    </em>
</p>

    <strong>
        NOTE: 
    </strong>
    This is an AUTOMATED message. This robot won't know how to behave if you try to respond to me!
